            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Samuel Nkemakolam, a 26-year-old digital media specialist and social media manager with a passion for cloud technology and cybersecurity. Curious, creative, and technically inclined, I enjoy drawing, singing, reading, solving puzzles, and figuring out how and why things work.

            <h2>Why I Joined Altschool</h2>
            <summary>
                <details><p>Technology, and the part computers play in it, has always fascinated me--be it resolving complex mathematical or societal problems into simple apps or connecting people and resources across the vastest distances in real or record time, technology drives innovation and is the pillar that bears up both the current and unfolding civilizations. My curiosity and innate desire to build and deconstruct systems has drawn me more and more toward engineering—-a field where I could explore and contribute to the rapidly evolving, software-powered tech landscape locally and globally.</p>  
                
                    <p>However, my journey to pursue a career in tech has been anything but straightforward. Life’s challenges, including managing medical bills and stepping up as the "dad of the house" when my father became incapacitated, forced me to put my dreams on hold and take on unfulfilling jobs to make ends meet.  
                    
                    <p>Nearly a decade later, the tech industry has grown into a hub of boundless opportunities, where skills, determination, and a hunger to grow often outweigh formal credentials. Likewise, my family had recovered to an extent where I could make safely make decisions for just me again. However, time was a luxury I now hesitated to commit fearing I had wasted too much of it anyway (a psychological inclination that made me struggle with consistency on platforms like Youtube/Udemy), plus, every other major bootcamp regarding tech just seemed too fast and expensive to be involved in.</p> 
                    
                    <p>That's where Altschool comes in.</p> 
                    
                    <p>The verve, the flexibility, the resource and financial support (Laptops and scholarships/discounts) and its overwhelming support from both the tech community and those without seemed like a sign to me from beyond. Though I did not quite make it past the second-phase of the scholarship stage, something had been rekindled; I was way too involved and invested in the idea and possibilities of a future in this field again to back down.</p></details>
                <p>AltSchool’s reputation for quality education, influential partnerships, and a growing global student community makes it an ideal platform for me. The exposure to diverse perspectives, cultures, and world-class instructors will not only enhance my skills but also help me build valuable connections and potential collaborations across the globe.</p>

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Cloud engineering sits at an exciting intersection between front-end and back-end engineering, making it consist of skillsets usually unique to either side whilst wrapped in its own distinct technicalities. Acquiring this broad knowlede-base is a crucial step toward my dream of contributing to and eventually founding a top-tier tech startup and "village" (A small district and community of digital nomads).</li>
                <li>I aim to come out of Altschool the very top or among the 1% of my class, performing so well that it would be difficult not to notice or recommend me in due time, whilst also proving that it’s never too late to chase your dreams.</li>
                <li>Another important goal for me would be to forge meaningful and long-lasting friendships and relationships that could potentially evolve into professional partnerships. Behind every successful solution in tech lies a motivated and dedicated team. Although challenging for me as a bonafide introvert, but hey, what we seek to become is usually outside our comfort zone.</li>
                <li>I would love to contribute to Altschool's overall operations. They really struggled with the onboarding of TINYUKA students</li>
                <li>To see my Altschool journey through to the very end.</li>
            </ul>
